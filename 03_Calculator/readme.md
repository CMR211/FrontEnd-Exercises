## About
Simple calculator app. Layout is based on Microsoft win10 one. Goal was to learn basic JS utilities (querySelectors, functions, math and string functions) and how to connect them with html elements. Secondary goal was to get better understanding of CSS flexbox/grid, variables, color mixing and material desgin.   

## Problems 
I tried to fix the floating point error however it still shows up sometimes. Besides there are almost no error messages or corrections. The UI doesn't feel as responsive as it could be as well.
